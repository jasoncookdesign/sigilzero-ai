# Aesthetic Framework

SIGIL.ZERO translates engineered sound into controlled visual form.  
The aesthetic is minimal, structural, and void-dominant.  
Mysticism is expressed through geometry and hardware logic — never fantasy.

## Core Principles

- Structure over ornament.  
- Void before color.  
- Geometry over illustration.  
- Precision over texture.  
- Control over chaos.

Mechanical mysticism. Rendered through technology.

## Graphic Language

- Negative space must dominate.  
- Deep black is the foundation of every asset.  
- Linework is thin, geometric, and intentional.  
- Symbols are constructed, never hand-drawn.  
- Distortion, if used, must feel engineered — not accidental.  

Visual weight should feel balanced, symmetrical, and deliberate.

## Color Logic

Color exists as signal — not decoration.

### Primary Field (Void)

Obsidian Black — #050505  
Void Black — #0A0A0F  
Deep Graphite — #1A1A1D  
Signal White — #F5F5F5  

### Accent Signal (Used Sparingly)

Neon Red — #FF0033  
Neon Cyan — #11F7FF  
Electric Violet — #C900FF  
Radiant Amber — #FFB422 (rare warmth only)

Accent color should punctuate. Never dominate.

## Typography

- Bold, geometric sans-serif.  
- Condensed forms preferred.  
- ALL CAPS for marks and headers.  
- Wide tracking.  
- No decorative serifs.  
- Logotype always rendered as: SIGIL.ZERO  

Typography must project authority and modernity without ornament.

## Series Distinction

Visual shifts must remain subtle and structural.

### Mainline
Neutral palette. Subtle cyan or white signal accents. Balanced geometry.

### BLACK
Black-dominant. Hard symmetry. Metallic tension. Red or violet accents.

### RED
Black foundation with controlled red signal. Kinetic line structures.

### VOID
Black with cyan/violet gradients. Fractured geometry. Spatial distortion.

All series remain within the same architectural system.

## Guardrails

- No horror imagery.  
- No literal religious symbolism.  
- No fantasy illustration.  
- No cyberpunk excess.  

The aesthetic is mysterious, not theatrical.  
Engineered, not decorative.
