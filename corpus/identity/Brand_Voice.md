# Brand Voice

SIGIL.ZERO communicates with precision and restraint.  
The voice reflects engineered sound, encoded symbolism, and institutional distance.  
It documents. It does not promote.

## Core Tone

- **Controlled.** Never loud. Never reactive.  
- **Mysterious.** Not horror. Not occult theater.  
- **Technical.** Grounded in circuitry, structure, and signal.  
- **Minimal.** Every word must justify its presence.  
- **Emotionally cool.** Detached, but aware of the pulse of the floor.

## Institutional Rules

- No first-person language.  
- No performative personality.  
- No urgency language.  
- No hype cycles.  
- presents artifacts. It does not chase attention.

Authority without urgency.  
Cadence over volume.  
Signal over noise.

---

## Sentence Structure

- Short. Declarative.  
- Fragments allowed for percussive effect.  
- Avoid adjective stacking.  
- Prefer mechanical verbs.

Approved verbs: activate, fracture, emerge, ignite, resonate, encode, construct, modulate.

## Core Lexicon

Language should orbit around:

signal  
construct  
sequence  
pattern  
resonance  
vector  
threshold  
artifact  
void  

Use metaphor sparingly.  
Imply structure. Do not explain it.

---

## Restricted Language

Use sparingly and metaphorically:

ancient  
ritual  
summoning  
forbidden  

Avoid fantasy drift.

---

## Banned Language

- Horror tropes: demonic, satanic, cursed, evil, possessed.  
- Hype language: smash, banger, epic, “don’t miss,” urgency copy.  
- Sci-fi cliché: dystopia, neon-drenched, cyberpunk excess.  
- Genre boxing: do not define the label as “a techno label.”

---

## Cadence and Presence

Silence is strategic.  
Releases are revealed, not hyped.  
Communication follows intent, not algorithmic pressure.  
High signal density is mandatory.
