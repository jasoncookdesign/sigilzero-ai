# Sound Philosophy

SIGIL.ZERO treats sound as engineered structure.  
Every release must demonstrate control, intention, and physical impact.  
Music is evaluated as architecture — not trend participation.

## Core Criteria

All submissions are evaluated against three non‑negotiables:

- **Structural Identity.** The track must possess a distinct sonic fingerprint. No generic genre templates.
- **Technical Control.** Precision across the frequency spectrum. Intentional dynamics. Clean execution.
- **Functional Power.** The music must move bodies, minds, or space with purpose.

Genre is secondary to structure.

## Production Standards

Technical excellence is baseline, not bonus.

- Controlled, phase‑aligned low end.  
- Defined transients without distortion reliance.  
- Designed sound — not preset dependency.  
- No masking, mud, or unintended clipping.  
- Delivered as 24‑bit WAV (44.1k or 48k).  

Unfinished sketches, uncleared samples, and low‑effort exports are rejected.

## Dancefloor Function

For club‑oriented releases:

- Groove must generate forward momentum.  
- Arrangements must demonstrate tension control.  
- Intro and outro structure must support DJ integration.  

Energy must be engineered, not accidental.

## Series Architecture

The catalog is organized into structural lanes. These are energy territories — not genre cages.

### Mainline

Hybrid, modern club forms. Balanced atmosphere and propulsion.

### BLACK

High‑impact density.  
Dark techno, heavy bass, neuro‑influenced breaks.  
Built for warehouse systems and late hours.

### RED

Forward motion and lift.  
Progressive structures, groove‑centric builds, kinetic drive.  
Designed for peak‑time expansion.

### VOID

Boundary dissolution.  
Glitch, halftime, abstract rhythm structures.  
Liminal listening and spatial experimentation.

All lanes operate within the same engineering discipline.

## AI Policy

Technology is a tool. Craft is mandatory.

- AI may assist ideation and acceleration.  
- Fully generative exports are not accepted.  
- Submissions must demonstrate substantial original production work.  
- AI use must be disclosed transparently.  

evaluates authorship, not automation.

Sound must withstand repetition.  
It must scale on large systems.  
It must reward close listening.

Engineered. Not accidental.
