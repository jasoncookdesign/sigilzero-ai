# Origin

SIGIL.ZERO emerged from subtraction.

Years of production, performance, and accumulated expectation created noise.  
The reset was intentional.

This imprint began as a deliberate clean slate — a space to release work without inherited momentum, trend pressure, or external validation.

## The Name

A sigil is a constructed mark — intentional, symbolic, focused.

Zero represents the reset point.  
No baggage.  
No preconception.  
No architectural residue.

Together, SIGIL.ZERO signifies building forward from nothing — with intent.

The identity is cryptic but disciplined.  
Dark, but never theatrical.  
Technological, not fantastical.

## From Reset to Institution

What began as a personal recalibration required structural independence.

was not designed to function as an extension of any individual persona.  
It was built as infrastructure — a container capable of outlasting its founder.

Experience from years inside the underground was distilled into system, not story.  
SIGIL.ZERO formalizes that distillation.

The institution stands separate from the artist.  
The mark remains even as individuals evolve.

A reset, formalized.  
A structure built from zero.  
Intent made permanent.
