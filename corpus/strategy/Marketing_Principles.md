# Marketing Principles

SIGIL.ZERO rejects retail logic.

No urgency mechanics.  
No performative hype.  
No algorithm chasing.

## Core Philosophy

- High signal density.  
- Strategic silence.  
- Archive unveiling.  
- Authority without urgency.

---

## Deployment

Communication follows release necessity.  
Not calendar obligation.

The mark builds gravity through restraint.
