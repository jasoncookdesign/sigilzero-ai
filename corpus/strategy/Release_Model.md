# Release Model

Releases follow disciplined cadence.

---

## Phase Structure

1. Tease  
2. Launch  
3. Afterglow  

Each phase is minimal and intentional.

---

## Catalog Discipline

Series architecture (BLACK / RED / VOID) scales only after catalog depth is established.

No premature fragmentation.

---

## Flagship Logic

Certain releases serve as anchor artifacts.  
These define trajectory and recalibrate expectation.

---

The release model favors endurance over volume.
