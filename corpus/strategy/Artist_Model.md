# Artist Model

SIGIL.ZERO operates as an institutional container for engineered work.

The artist creates.  
curates, formalizes, and amplifies.

Roles remain distinct.

---

## Structural Relationship

- 50/50 net revenue split.  
- No advances.  
- Transparent accounting.  
- Clear DSP ownership boundaries.  

provides infrastructure, not dependency.

---

## Submission Standards

Artists must align with:

- Technical discipline.  
- Structural identity.  
- Long-term thinking.  

Low-effort output is rejected.  
Volume does not replace craft.

---

## Identity Separation

SIGIL.ZERO is not a personality.  
It does not collapse into any single artist.

Founders, collaborators, and contributors operate within the container — not as the container.

The mark remains independent.
